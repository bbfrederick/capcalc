The PICAchooser package
=======================

PICAchooser is a suite of simple gui tools for scanning through MELODIC probabalistic ICA
runs and quickly making decisions about which components are worth keeping, and
what relates to what. These tools each only do one thing, but they do them
quickly and easily using only keyboard input. Current programs are
PICAchooser, melodicomp, and grader.
